# What is a BetaComp?

A BetaComp is a **group** of Climbing competitions which test a Climber's [<beta>Beta</beta>](/guide/What/WhatBeta), not just a Climber's ability to complete a [ <route>Route</route> ](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) or how fast they can complete a [ <route>Route</route> ](/reference/Route/RouteOverview).

BetaComp mimics the competition structures of other Olympic Sports. Following the names of other  sports, in the Olympics BetaComp would be called "*Freestyle* Climbing" (like *Freestyle* Skiing) or "*Artistic* Climbing" (like *Artistic* Gymnastics).


::: tip Even if a BetaComp never makes it into the Olympics, it will still [provide value](/guide/Why/AddValue) to the Climbing community and beyond.

You don't need to have a formal competition hosted by a gym to compete in a BetaComp!

::: tip HOW not IF
The main difference between BetaComp and all other Olympic Climbing Events is that **Climbers are scored on HOW they climb a <route>Route</route>  just IF they can climb the  <route>Route</route> .**
