# Coding

BetaComp uses Vitepress and Vue.js to create this website. Both are open source projects, which means that they are free to use and are not controlled by a single business. 




## Vue.js

Vue was chosen for BetaComp for a few reasons. 

- Vitepress iself is created with Vue
- Vue is an open source project
- There is a large community of Vue users, so there is lots of support when problems inevitably arise.


### Scoring App

Vue will be used to create the interface that judges use to input scores. Similar to the Trivium Scoring 


## Vitepress

Vitepress has a similar role to the popular publishing tool called Wordpress.

Vitepress was chosen for BetaComp for the following reasons:

- Vitepress is an open source project.
- Like the name suggests, Vitepress is very fast at loading the website.
- Vitepress works (and looks good) on any screensize.
- Vitepress is highly customizable.
