## â™» How BetaComp was Inspired by [Coyote Rock Gym](https://www.instagram.com/thecoyoterockgym)

### â™» Inspired as a Climber
- Red Cave
- P
### â™» Inspired as a Setter

#### ðŸ”· Setting Inspired DifficultyScore
- RICscale from My Keys to Routesetting.
- Prioritize Complexity over Intensity.
    - Spurred on by the feedback from a former setter "The <route>Routes</route> are less cryptic than before", which I took to mean that the <route>Route</route> were lacking complexity.
    - Didn't like CrimpGrip

#### ðŸ”· BetaWall Inspired by Setting a SprayWall
- Backfill Wall is BetaWall.
- Volume Construction
- Top Rope
- Boulders
#### ðŸ”· Beta System Inspired by Routesetting Clinic

While at Coyote Rock Gym I was able to help run a Routesetting Clinic, then a year later I convinced the owners to allow members to try routesetting under my supervision.

- Lack of Guidance on how to develop as a Routesetter
- Lack of reference material Inspired the creation of [Reference Section](/reference/ReferenceOverview)
    - Movement Library exists.
    - Only basic glossaries of setting terminology exists.

BetaRoute was inspired by all the time spent thinking about all the alternatives to a <route>Route</route> which is being set. Trying to BreakBeta is a form of BetaRoute Competition. 

### â™» Inspired as a Coach
BetaComp was inspired by the climbing games and training drills which are used by coaches.

### NonDualClimbing
- What is actually happening when a climber is climbing, from the first person perspective. 

### Joseph Goldstein
When you interlace your hands together, what do you experience? You don't experience 'Hand', you experience temperature and pressure which our minds categorize into 'Hand'. Likewise, when you're climbing and you feel off balance, what are you actually experiencing.
