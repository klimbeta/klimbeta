## ♻ How BetaComp was Inspired by [Coyote Rock Gym](https://www.instagram.com/thecoyoterockgym)

### ♻ Inspired as a Climber
- Red Cave
- P
### ♻ Inspired as a Setter

- RICscale from My Keys to Routesetting.
- Backfill Wall is BetaWall.
- Volume Construction
- Top Rope
- Boulders
- Prioritize Complexity over Intensity.
    - Spurred on by the feedback from a former setter "The routes are less cryptic than before", which I took to mean that the route were lacking complexity.
    - Didn't like CrimpGrip
- Routesetting Clinic
    - Lack of Guide
    - Movement Library

BetaRoute was inspired by all the time spent thinking about all the alternatives to a route which is being set. Trying to BreakBeta is a form of BetaRoute Competition. 

### ♻ Inspired as a Coach
BetaComp was inspired by the climbing games and training drills which are used by coaches.
