## Reference Class Forecasting

Since BetaComp is a new invention it can seem risky because it's never been done before. The risk of BetaComp is reduced by using a concept called *Reference Class Forecasting*, which has created by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Daniel Kahneman has won the Nobel Prize and has written the about *Reference Class Forecasting* in his popular book **Thinking Fast and Slow**. Defined in the Harvard Business Review as:

> Kahneman and Tversky suggested using an outside view to develop more realistic project plans. They proposed using a forecasting technique called reference class forecasting, by which projects' durations or costs are predicted by comparing a project of interest to a set of past similar projects

The class or category that BetaComp refers to is a competition where difficulty and execution are scored.


## Frankenstein Rulebook

BetaComp takes parts from each of the other sport's rulebooks.

::: tip Using Skateboarding's Use Of Course and Variety Of Obstacles for Route Difficulty Score 

Refers to the manner in which an athlete navigates the course and utilizes the
obstacles within. An athlete may choose to perform tricks on a few obstacles throughout the
course or on many obstacles throughout the course. A wider, unique, and more difficult variety
of course use is favorable.
