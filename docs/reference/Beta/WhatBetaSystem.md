# Beta System

BetaComp uses a systemized form of Beta which has it's own way of writing Beta.

::: warning  Beta System is [Descriptive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/descriptive), not [Prescriptive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prescriptive).

The BetaComp has no intention to limit Climbers through the use of the BetaSystem. The BetaSystem is merely a tool to describe what a Climber does or thinks. The BetaSystem is designed to be open to new additions and it will take a [long time](/development/Roadmap) to completely describe Climbing, perhaps there are some aspects of Climbing which can not be described.

Although the BetaSystem is useful for all types of Climbing, Climbers don't need to use the BetaSystem outside of BetaComps if you don't want to.

## What does 'Beta' mean in a BetaComp? 

BetaComp defines Beta as a system composed of four subsystems: [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview), [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview), [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview), and [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview). Each subsystem or aspect of Beta affects the other aspects of Beta. Everything is connected.

## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Climber climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Climbing. Usually when a Climber talks about a Route they are referring to the [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview), which is an element of the Environment.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a Climber ascends a [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview) using a particular color of holds and another Climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first Climber, but skips half of them, then did both Climbers climb the same Route?


> If a Climber [FootSmears](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a colored indoor hold, are they [OffRoute](/reference/Glossary#offroute) because they're not touching a colored hold?
