# Beta System

Klimbeta uses a systemized form of <beta>Beta</beta> which has it's own way of writing <beta>Beta</beta>.

::: warning  Beta System is [Descriptive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/descriptive), not [Prescriptive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prescriptive).

The Klimbeta has no intention to limit Climbers through the use of the <beta>BetaSystem</beta>. The <beta>BetaSystem</beta> is merely a tool to describe what a Climber does or thinks. The <beta>BetaSystem</beta> is designed to be open to new additions and it will take a [long time](/development/Roadmap) to completely describe Climbing, perhaps there are some aspects of Climbing which can not be described.

Although the <beta>BetaSystem</beta> is useful for all types of Climbing, Climbers don't need to use the <beta>BetaSystem</beta> outside of BetaComps if you don't want to.

## What does 'Beta' mean in a Klimbeta? 

Klimbeta defines Beta as a system composed of four subsystems: [<envi>Environment</envi>](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview), [<move>Move</move>](/reference/Move/MoveOverview), [ <route>Route</route> ](/reference/Route/RouteOverview), and [<neuro>Neuro</neuro>](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview). Each subsystem or aspect of Beta affects the other aspects of Beta. Everything is connected.

## What is the difference between <envi>Environment</envi> and <route>Route</route>?

Philosophically, a [ <route>Route</route> ](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [<envi>Environment</envi>](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The <route>Route</route> **only** exists in the minds of Climbers. There are no <route>start holds</route> in <envi>nature</envi>. The <envi>Environment</envi> is Concrete and exists whether or not a Climber climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the <envi>Environment</envi>.

The [<envi>Environment</envi>](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Climbing. Usually when a Climber talks about a <route>Route</route> they are referring to the [<envi>Wall</envi>](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview), which is an element of the <envi>Environment</envi>.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a Climber ascends a [<envi>Wall</envi>](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview) using a <route>particular color of holds</route> and another Climber comes along ascends the same <envi>Wall</envi> using the same <route>color of holds</route> as the first Climber, but <route>skips half of them</route>, then did both Climbers climb the same <route>Route</route>?


> If a Climber [<move>FootSmears</move>](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a <route>colored indoor hold</route>, are they [<route>OffRoute</route>](/reference/Glossary#offroute) because they're not touching a colored hold?
