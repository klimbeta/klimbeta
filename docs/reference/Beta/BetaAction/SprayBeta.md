## Why not SprayBeta?

SprayBeta is like spoiling the plot of a movie or solving someone's puzzle. Part of the fun of climbing is problem solving, so when someone sprays beta they are reducing the potential fun that a climber can have while trying a route.

Sometimes the sprayed Beta isn't even useful.

## Spray Range

Beta can be sprayed from one climber to another in a normal speaking volume or Beta can be sprayed over a larger range when it is yelled at a climber who is on the wall.
