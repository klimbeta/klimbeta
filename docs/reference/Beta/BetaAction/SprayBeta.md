## Definition of SprayBeta

- Unsolicited GiveBeta.

- GiveBeta without AskBeta.

- Beta is "sprayed" when Beta is given without being asked for it.

- Can be a form of "mansplaining"

## Why not SprayBeta?

SprayBeta is like spoiling the plot of a movie or solving someone's puzzle. Part of the fun of Climbing is problem solving, so when someone sprays Beta they are reducing the potential fun that a Climber can have while trying a Route.

Sometimes the sprayed Beta isn't even useful.

## Spray Range

Beta can be sprayed from one Climber to another in a normal speaking volume or Beta can be sprayed over a larger range when it is yelled at a Climber who is on the wall.
