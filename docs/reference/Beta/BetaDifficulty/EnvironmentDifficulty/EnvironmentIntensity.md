How the Environment 


### Relationship between EnvironmentIntensity and RouteIntensity

EnvironmentIntensity is independent of Route Intensity, Move Intensity, NeuroIntensity

WallAngle

### Relationship between EnvironmentIntensity and Move Intensity


### Relationship between EnvironmentIntensity and Neuro Intensity

Environment Causes Panic
- Fear can be LowIntensity, HighIntensity Fear is Panic.
- Fear of Falling
- Deep Water Solo

- Performance Anxiety
    - Climbing in front of Spectators


## Examples of Environment Intensity



### Low Environment Intensity



### High Environment Intensity
- RoofWall
- WetWall
- Deep Water Solo



## Advantage

WallAngle
- Overhangs can be easier for ShortClimber.
    - CoreTension
    - FrontLever
    - Gainage
- ShortClimber has less leverage when performing movements which require FrontLever or Gainage.


HighAltitude Acclimatization
- Vail

## Altitude

- RouteIntensity(++)
    - Competitions held in Vail where concentration of Oxygen is lower.
    - Altitude sickness
        - Feel out of breath, nausea, fatigue
- StrongWind
    - Being blown off the Wall.
    - AirResistance during Dyno.
- WarmAir
    - AirTemperature
        - Sending Temps
        - Sweat affects Intensity.
- WarmLoadingSurface
    - WallTemperature
        - WarmRock
            - SunExposure
        - Wall is heated by the sun, causing sweating.
            - DawnWall

## Wet

When MargoHayes attempted Biographie(9a+) while it was WetRoute.



## Wall Angle

- SlabWall
    - Gravity decreases Grip Intensity of Vector into Wall as the WallAngle becomes more SlabWall.
- Gravity increases Grip Intensity as the WallAngle becomes more OverhangWall.
    - PinchGrip on a RoofWall.

- (WallAngle+SurfaceAngle+LoadingAngle)
    - Intense in which Direction. Grip can be intense IntoWall, DownWall, UpWall, OutOfWall. PinchGrip.Error.Slide on VerticalWall, slides DownWall, which PinchGrip.Error.Slide on OverhangWall is OutOfWall.
        - (MovementDirection)RelativeTo(Route)
            - IntoWall, DownWall, UpWall, OutOfWall
