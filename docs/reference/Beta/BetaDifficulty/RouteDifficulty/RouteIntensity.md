# üî∑üî∫ <route>Route</route> Intensity

## Definition

### Relationship between <route>Route</route> Intensity and <move>Move Intensity</move>

Routes determine the minimum intensity of a move.

Climbers can perform a really intense move which is more intense than it needs to be.
- Climbing with <move>TRexArm</move> is more intense than ArmHang with straight arms, both are performed on the same route.

- Holds that are far apart are HighIntensity due to the large distance between them. A Tall Climber can ArmReach with LowIntensity while a ShortClimber must <move>Dyno</move> with HighIntensity for the same route. Does this mean that Route Intensity is relative to climber? No, the Beta is more intense but the Route Intensity stays the same. Beta is more intense for ShortClimber than TallClimber.

- <route>Route</route> Intensity is independent of MoveIntensity.

- MoveIntensity depends on RouteIntensity.

## Friction

- RouteSurfaceIntensity(+)
    - SmoothSurfaceTexture
    - SmallContactSize
    - WetSurface
    -   - Low CoefficientOfFriction



- RouteSurfaceIntensity(-)
    - LargeContactSize
    - Greater CoefficientOfFriction requires less Force to be Static. Climber doesn‚Äôt need to apply as much force into a RoughTexture LoadingSurface.

- KineticFriction
    - Definition(KineticFriction)
        - A force that acts between Sliding ClimberContact and LoadingSurface.
    - SlideMovement

- StaticFriction
    - Definition(StaticFriction)
        - The Force that keeps ContactSurface and LoadingSurface from Sliding.
    - StaticContactMovement
        - Definition(StaticContactMovement)
            - Movements which don‚Äôt Slide. 
            - PivotMovements Slide as they Rotate.

    - Take enough weight off feet to be able to FootSlide them when Stemming or during to make space on SmallHold  FootSwap on a SmallHold
### CoefficientOfFriction
- Definition(CoefficientOfFriction)
    - The ratio of the Frictional resistance force to the normal force which presses the Surfaces together.
    - A lower coefficient of Friction on a LoadingSurface increases the Intensity of the Grip.

        - ‚ÄúIn Tokyo at least we can finally see the sea but the fact that it's hundred meters away from the climbing venue it's not so nice for a climbing conditions is gonna be humid another kind of cloud or who is very sensitive to the perfect conditions I like it cold I like it windy‚Äù

    - Sweat
        - Climbers can make WetLoadingSurface by sweating on the LoadingSurface. AdamOndra waited for a Breeze for his 9a+ Flash attempt so that the wind could dry his sweat while climbing.
