# CognitiveEase

![CogntiveEase_00](/Neuro/CognitiveEase_00.png)

## Factors to induce CognitiveEase:
### ClarityEase
- TicMark
- ChalkSmear
- CrackSystem
- RouteLine.ClarityEase((WallCorner, WallCrack) < (“Zigzag on FaceWall”))
### GoodEase

> “On a roll”

### RepetitionEase
- RepeatedMovementSequence
    - Climber performs a MovementSequence so many times that they no longer need to consciously think about what they’re doing
        > “On autopilot”
        
        >“My brain just shut off”
        
        >“I went into full blackout mode”

    - SpeedClimbing


## CognitiveEase is Perceived by:

    “Easy”
    “Easier”
    “Easiest”
### FeelsTrue
- Correct
- Right
- True

> “That [Movement, MovementPattern, Sequence] feels like it will work”

### FeelsEffortless
- Efficient

>“Flying up the route”

### FeelsGood
- Comfortable

> “In your comfort zone”

> “Within your climbing ability limit”

> “That felt good”

Joy

> “Feels fun”

> “Feels amusing”

- Amusement
### FeelsFamiliar
- HomeGymAdvantage
- Analogy

> “I’ve done a similar movement to this before”


## Thinking Fast and Slow

![ThinkingFastAndSlow](/Neuro/ThinkingFastAndSlow.png)
- In 2011 Daniel Kahneman framed a way to understand cognition in  Thinking Fast and Slow. In the book he splits cognition into two systems, System1 and System2.
- Here are some video explanations of the two systems.

    - [The Science of Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&t=15s&ab_channel=Veritasium)

### System 1 (Fast Thinking)

#### Characteristics of System 1 (Fast Thinking)
- ThinkingFastAndSlow page 105
- generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
- operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control
- can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)
- executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training
- creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory
- links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance
- distinguishes the surprising from the normal
- infers and invents causes and intentions
- neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt
- is biased to believe and confirm
exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)
- focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)
generates a limited set of basic assessments
- represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate
- matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness)
- computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
- sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)
- is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)*
overweights low probabilities*
- shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)*
- responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)*
- frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from on another”

#### Examples of System 1 (Fast Thinking)
- Determine that an object is at a greater distance than another
- Localize the source of a specific sound
- Complete the phrase "war and ..."
- Display disgust when seeing a gruesome image
- Solve 2+2=?
- Read text on a billboard
- Drive a car on an empty road
- Think of a good chess move (if you're a chess master)
- Understand simple sentences
- Associate the description 'quiet and structured person with an eye for details' with a specific job

- CoordinationMovement
    - RapidCognition
    - ReflexMovement
    - ContactStrength
    - HandCatch
    - FootCatch

- Intuition
    - OnsightAttempt

## System 2 (Slow Thinking)

Definition(Deliberate)
- To think about or discuss issues and decisions carefully.

Lazy Controller
- Complacency
- Substitution
    - Thinking about hand placement instead of TorsoPosition, ShoulderPosition, ElbowPosition. Deadpoints rely on the Proprioceptive ability to attain optimal BodyPosition more than Muscle or Acceleration.
        - ClimberPosition = Requires(Proprioception)
        - (“Optimization of movement” < MovementIntensity(++))CognitiveEase\MovementComplexityLow
            - Increasing MovementIntensity is a cognitive action. 


### Examples of System 2

- Prepare yourself for the start of a sprint
- Direct your attention towards the clowns at the circus
- Direct your attention towards someone at a loud party
- Look for the woman with the grey hair
- Try to recognize a sound
- Sustain a faster-than-normal walking rate
- Determine the appropriateness of a particular behavior in a social setting
- Count the number of A's in a certain text
- Give someone your telephone number
- Park into a tight parking space
- Determine the price/quality ratio of two washing machines
- Determine the validity of a complex logical reasoning
- Solve 17 × 24
