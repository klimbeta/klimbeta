## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a climber climbs it. A skill of climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in climbing. Usually when a climber talks about a route they are referring to the Wall, which is an element of the Environment.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a climber ascends a Wall using a particular color of holds and another climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first climber, but skips half of them, then did both climbers climb the same route?


> If a climber [FootSmears](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a colored indoor hold, are they off route because they're not touching a colored hold?

## What is a Route actually composed of?

### RouteSurface

> A **RouteSurface** is any surface of the [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) which a climber contacts while performing a [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview).

### RouteSpace
> A **RouteSpace** is the area in an [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview)'s space which a climber passes through while performing a [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview).

- An example of RouteSpace is CrackClimbing, the RouteSpace is between the two sides of the [CrackWall](). 


### RouteLine
> A **RouteLine** is a series of points in an [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview)'s space which a climber passes along while performing a [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview). 

- A perfect example of RouteLine that every coach knows well is *"keep your hips close to the wall!"*. The climber's hips aren't necessarily contacting the wall, but they must pass through a specific


::: tip 
The difference between [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) and [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is most important during a [BetaWall](/reference/CompType/BetaWall) competition, where there is a fixed Route that climbers must follow, instead each climber chooses their route and moves on the wall.

## RockWall Route

A RockWall route starts on the ground, a ledge or an anchor and finishes on at the top of the wall, a ledge or an anchor.
