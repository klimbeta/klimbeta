## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a climber climbs it. A skill of climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

- The Environment is a novel concept in climbing. Usually when a climber talks about a route they are referring to the Wall, which is an element of the Environment.
- A Route is not a Route unless it leads you to your target location. 
- If a section of a Wall can not be climbed then there is no Route only Wall.
- Ascending and descending the same section of a wall are two different routes even though they both use the exact same wall. 
- A Route is the part of the Environment which makes contact with a Climber. 
- If a climber ascends a Wall using a particular color of holds and another climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first climber, but skips half of them, then did both climbers climb the same route?

The difference between Route and Environment is most important during a BetaWall competition, where there is fixed route that climbers must follow, instead each climber chooses their route and moves on the wall.



## RouteSurface
The EnvironmentSurface that a Climber contacts to advance along a route.

## RouteSpace

The EnvironmentSpace that a Climber passes through to advance along a route.

## RockWall Route

A RockWall route starts on the ground, a ledge or an anchor and finishes on at the top of the wall, a ledge or an anchor.


## ArtificialWall Route

### MonochromeRoute

Each route uses only one color of hold.

### PolychromeRoute

PolychromeRoutes are where you climb a route which uses more than one color of hold.

PolychromeRoutes are popular in Japan

- PolychromeRoutes can be denoted with colored tape.
- Multiple PolychromeRoutes can share the same holds.
