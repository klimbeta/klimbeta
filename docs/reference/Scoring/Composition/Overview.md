## Progression

### New or Uncommon Elements

Progression can be recognized at any level of competition since it does not rely on MoveIntensity.

Naming new Elements after yourself is common practice in gymnastics, it is **not permitted**. Naming Elements after yourself hinders understanding of the new Element since it is not descriptive. Moreover naming Elements after people encourages having a big ego and ignores the fact that no innovation occurs in isolation. It is not fair to ignore the role of the climbing community in a climber's innovation. Having descriptive ElementNames is critical for the accessibilty of BetaComps.
