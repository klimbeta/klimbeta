# Difficulty Score Overview

Based on the **RICscale** which was developed by Tonde Katiyo and Jacky Godoffe, and was first published in Godoffe's book [My Keys to Routesetting](http://jackygodoffe.com/book.html). The RICscale is an acronym for Risk, Intensity, and Complexity. Sometimes 'E' is added to the scale for Emotion, BetaComp places emotion in the [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview) part of Beta instead.

The RICscale is used mostly by Routesetters to design and describe their routes. In a BetaComp the RICscale can be applied to Routes, Moves, and to the Wall itself.
