Based on the **RICscale** first published in Jacky Godoffe's book [My Keys to Routesetting](http://jackygodoffe.com/book.html). The RICscale is an acronym for Risk, Intensity, and Complexity.

The RICscale is used mostly by Routesetters to design and describe their routes. In a BetaComp the RICscale can be applied to Routes, Moves, and to the Wall itself.
