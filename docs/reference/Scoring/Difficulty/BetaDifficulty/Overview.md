# Beta Difficulty Overview

Beta Difficulty describes the total difficulty of a climber's performance.

Neuro is not scored in a BetaComp since it is difficult to observe directly and can be observed indirectly in the Move and Route of a climber's performance. The only place where Neuro could be observed in a climber is their emotional facial expressions, but climbers are almost always facing the wall, so their face can't be seen.  

- Move Hesitation
- Route Alignment
