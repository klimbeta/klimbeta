### Relationship between Move Intensity and Route Intensity

Routes determine the minimum intensity of a move.

Climbers can perform a really intense move which is more intense than it needs to be.
- Climbing with TRexArm is more intense than ArmHang with straight arms, both are performed on the same route.

- Holds that are far apart are HighIntensity due to the large distance between them. A Tall Climber can ArmReach with LowIntensity while a ShortClimber must Dyno with HighIntensity for the same route. Does this mean that Route Intensity is relative to climber? No, the Beta is more intense but the Route Intensity stays the same. Beta is more intense for ShortClimber than TallClimber.

- Route Intensity is independent of MoveIntensity.

- MoveIntensity depends on RouteIntensity.

### Relationship between Move Intensity and Neuro Intensity

MoveComplexity increases NeuroIntensity

High MoveIntensity increases NeuroIntensity
- Maximum Neuromuscular Recruitment for an explosive Dyno Move  
- Dealing with the Pain of ArmPump


## Examples of Move Intensity


### Low Move Intensity


### High Move Intensity

- LongArmReach
    - (LegLongReach.Intensity(--))ProportionalTo(LegLength(++))

- LongArmReach
    - (ArmLongReach.Intensity(--))ProportionalTo(ArmLength(++))

ShortPersonBeta
- ShortClimber can be able to Load IntermediateSurface when TallClimber can not.
- SingleLegSquats are easier for ShortClimbers since they must travel less distance and the MomentArmLength of ShortClimbers‚Äôs limbs are smaller, therefore requiring less Torque, therefore less MuscleContractionEnergy than TallClimber performing a SingleLegSquat.
