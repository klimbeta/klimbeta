# üî∑üü† Move Complexity

## Definition
- Consisting of many different and connected parts.
- Interwoven, interrelated.
- Continuum between Simple and Complex.
- ‚ÄúClimbing is an incredibly demanding sport. Successful climbers combine strength, endurance, power, flexibility, mobility, and dexterity of both mind and body. Climbing requires a complex synergy between all of these abilities, relying on the successful integration of spatial awareness, balance, and coordination.‚Äù




## Examples of Move Complexity



### Low Move Complexity



### High Move Complexity

## Move Sequence

- Thinking moves ahead. Ahead of CurrentMovement.
    - EventCount
        - Number of Events
    - SubmovementCount
        - Number of Submovements
    - PositionCount
        - Number of Positions
    - Analogy(Chess)


## Advantage

- Shorter Climbers often must use a more complex Beta than a TallClimber who can just Bypass the movement.
- CognitiveBias
    - CurseOfKnowledge
        - The Routesetter who set the Route already knows all the beta to a climb may underestimate all the thought required to discover the beta.
- HomeGymAdvantage
    - Climber already knows how the Hold feels when competing at their home gym.

## Movement Repeatability

## Rest

- Neuro
    - Timing
        - Knowing when to rest
- Resting often isn‚Äôt PassiveMovement. ShakeMovements are not PassiveMovement. Knowing how to get muscles to relax is a skill.


## Move Sequence

- Notation
    - [,]
        - [StandUp, UnderclingHold]
            - MovementSequence[CrimpGrip, SpoonSmear, CrimpGrip]


- Differentiate(Timing, Sequencing)
Timing is often used erroneously instead of sequence.
- Sequencing is ordered, but without Duration of Submovements
- On(Event) = Sequence
    - On(ClimberPosition)
        - [RockOver, LegSquat]
    - On(Sensation)
        - On(FootContact)
            - Pressure of FootContacting and Loading Surface.
        - On(HandContact)
            - Touch Sensation when FingerContact TargetSurface.
    - On(Proprioception)
    - On(Stretch)
        - LegWhip into Wall when LegAnteriorMuscles are stretched to their MaximumMuscleLength, during LegBackSwing.

- On(Time) = Timing
    - On(30second)\RestTime during a CompetitionRound
    - Timing can be used when HiddenClimberPosition or Position isn‚Äôt clear, such as when knowing when to HandRelease during Dyno.LaunchPhase.
    - ClimberPosition is often more clear to the Spectator than to the Climber on the Route.
