## Definition

### Relationship between <move>MoveIntensity</move> and <route>RouteIntensity</route>

Routes determine the minimum intensity of a <move>move</move>.

Climbers can perform a really intense move which is more intense than it needs to be.
- Climbing with <move>TRexArm</move> is more intense than <move>ArmHang</move> with straight arms, both are performed on the same <route>route</route>.

- Holds that are far apart are HighIntensity due to the large distance between them. A Tall Climber can <move>ArmReach</move> with LowIntensity while a ShortClimber must <move>Dyno</move> with HighIntensity for the same <route>route</route>. Does this mean that Route Intensity is relative to climber? No, the <beta>Beta</beta> is more intense but the Route Intensity stays the same. <beta>Beta</beta> is more intense for ShortClimber than TallClimber.

- Route Intensity is independent of MoveIntensity.

- MoveIntensity depends on RouteIntensity.

### Relationship between <neuro>MoveIntensity</neuro> and <neuro>NeuroIntensity</neuro>

MoveComplexity increases NeuroIntensity

High MoveIntensity increases NeuroIntensity
- Maximum Neuromuscular Recruitment for an explosive Dyno Move  
- Dealing with the Pain of ArmPump

## Work
- Definition(Work)
    - Work, in physics, measures the energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an external force at least part of which is applied in the direction of the displacement. If the force is constant, work may be computed by multiplying the length of the path by the component of the force acting along the path.
    - No work is done unless the object is displaced in some way and there is a component of the force along the path over which the object is moved. Holding a heavy object stationary does not transfer energy to it, because there is no displacement.
