# BetaDance Competition

## What?
A BetaDance competition is not currently possible, but not impossible in the future. 

There are too few, if any, climbers who have attempted to climb to music. The closest thing to a BetaDance occurs in the performances of the Cirque Du Solei. Most of their climbing isn't performed on a Wall and often involves elements unrelated to climbing, such as the trampoline in this video.

### Music
No climber is good enough to climb to music, but after a few years of BetaComp climbers will probably be able to climb to a simple beat.

Like in Breaking, Climbers will be judged on their Musicality. 
- Moving the Rhythm of the music.
- Beta fits the theme of the music. 
    - Aggressive
    - Smooth
    - Staccato
