# BetaDance Competition


::: danger ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  
BetaDance is NOT currently being developed, since the other more simple types of BetaComp must be implemented and tested before BetaDance will be able to take place.

## What?
A BetaDance competition is not currently possible, but not impossible in the future. 

There are too few, if any, Climbers who have attempted to climb to music. The closest thing to a BetaDance occurs in the performances of the Cirque Du Solei. Most of their Climbing isn't performed on a Wall and often involves elements unrelated to Climbing, such as the trampoline in this video.

### Music
No Climber is good enough to climb to music, but after a few years of BetaComp Climbers will probably be able to climb to a simple beat.

Like in Breaking, Climbers will be judged on their Musicality. 
- Moving the Rhythm of the music.
- Beta fits the theme of the music. 
    - Aggressive
    - Smooth
    - Staccato
