## What?

MetaBetaComp has the most amusing name of all comps, but is the most complex of all the BetaComp types since competitors must be both skilled at routesetting and [BetaClimbing](/guide/What/WhatBeta).

Routesetters set a Route or Wall then climb it themselves or another team member climbs it.

Each Team is given the same blank Wall, Volumes and Holds.
