# ForcedBeta Competition

What every routesetter dreams of.

Climbers are told the beta that they must perform  the moves and route they must take and are scored on the number of attempts it takes to complete the beta

Similar to Route comps, beta can be flashed or take multiple attempts to perform the Beta.

Breaking Beta is not permitted!
