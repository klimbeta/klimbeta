# üî∫ BetaRoute Competition

A Beta Route Competition is the easiest BetaComp type to understand and run, since it is the most similar to current Climbing Competitions. 

## What is a BetaRoute Competition?

A BetaRoute competition is a climbing competition where climbers get [one attempt](/reference/CompType/BetaRoute#onsight-only) to climb a route and are scored on How they climb the route. 

A Route is chosen and Climbers are scored on the difficulty of the Moves and execution of the Moves that they perform on the Route.

Speed Climbing Competitions are similar to BetaRoute competitions since they both test **HOW** a climber climbs a route and not **IF** a climber can climb the route.

Both the [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) and the [Moves](/reference/Move/MoveOverview) that the Climber must execute are [fixed](/reference/Glossary#fixed).

Climbers are expected to be able to complete the Route

### [Onsight](/reference/Glossary#onsight) Only

In a BetaRoute competition, each Climber gets **only one** [Attempt](/reference/Glossary#attempt) per Route.

Attempt starts when climber makes contact with Route with **any part** of their body.

### ‚è≥ Timelimit

Each Climber has 50 seconds to view the Route from the ground without contacting it.

After a climber's viewing time is over, the climber has 10 seconds to start the route.

Once on the Route the Climber has a maximum of 2 minutes to complete the Route.

Resting on the Route can reduce a Climber's Execution Score.

### Similar BetaComp Competitions

- [ForcedBeta](/reference/CompType/ForcedBeta)


## Who?

- A group of climbers who can climb a minimum route grade.
    - Since BetaRoute competitions expect all climbers to complete the routes in the competition, even climbers that can only climb relatively easy route grades can compete against each other. 

## Where?



## Implementation

- Climbers can practice on the route before the competition.
- Get required Judges.
- Advertise Competition on Social Media and Poster

- Set the Route(s)
- Print all Scoring Sheets

- When to Brush Holds during competition?
- Determine how many rounds based on the number of climbers and Routes.

- Post Scores

### How can Climbers train for a BetaRoute Competition?

Climbers need to familarize themselves with the [BetaElements](/reference/Beta/WhatBetaSystem#BetaElements) in the [Reference Section](/reference/ReferenceOverview).

Climbers need to understand the basics of [BetaScore](/reference/Score/Overview).

### How do Setters set the Competition?


### What is the Judging process for a BetaRoute Competition?

How many Judges?

## Why?

To see who can climb with the greatest ease

Effortlessly

### Test Climbing Technique Instead Of Musclar Strength

To make climbers who's technique far surpasses their brute strength

- A Climber who can crush a V9 could lose to a climber who can only Climb V3, if the V3 climber finds the optimal Beta, while the V9 Climber just relies on their muscular strength.

- It's very easy to climb an easy route with [inoptimal](/reference/Scoring/Overview#) form.


### What is BetaRoute testing?

- Ability to plan how to Read the route. Since Climbers only have 50 seconds to look at the Route before starting, they must efficiently plan how they read the route.
    - Where the Route [Starts]() and [Finishes]()
    - What Moves they need to perform

- Ability to [Onsight](/reference/Glossary#onsight)
    - React to Errors
    - Decide which Beta Alternatives to choose.



### Benefits for Climbers

Increases Climber's Ability to [RouteRead](/reference/Beta/BetaAction/ReadBeta#route-reading) since BetaComp [integrates](/guide/Why/Value#integrates) [setting](/officials/Setter/Overview) into Climbing so that Climbers can gain a [better understanding](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview) of what the setting team's [intended beta](/reference/CompType/ForcedBeta) is. 

Increases Climber's ability to find the easiest Route in an Environment.

Climbers can compete against other climbers at their same level. 

Novice Climbers can beat ExperiencedClimbers.

TallPerson Beta and Short Person Beta becomes irrelevant, so kids can compete against adults.

### Benefits for Setters

Setters can mislead Climbers.

Since Climbers only have one attempt, setters can experiment in creating false routes, just like on Rock. Often when Climbers are climbing on Rock they have many potential EnvironmentSurfaces which could be used as RouteSurfaces but are not necessary and can actually take climbers [OffRoute](/reference/Glossary#offroute) 

### Benefits for Coaches



### Benefit for Gyms 

Gyms benefit from BetaRoute competitions by increasing the accessiblity


Climbers are divided into RouteGrades
