# üî∫ <route>BetaRoute Competition</route>

A Beta <route>Route</route> Competition is the easiest BetaComp type to understand and run, since it is the most similar to current Climbing Competitions. 

## What is a BetaRoute Competition?

A BetaRoute competition is a climbing competition where climbers get [one attempt](/reference/CompType/BetaRoute#onsight-only) to climb a <route>Route</route> and are scored on How they climb the  <route>Route</route> . 

A <route>Route</route> is chosen and Climbers are scored on the difficulty of the <move>Moves</move> and execution of the <move>Moves</move> that they perform on the  <route>Route</route> .

Speed Climbing Competitions are similar to BetaRoute competitions since they both test **HOW** a climber climbs a <route>Route</route> and not **IF** a climber can climb the  <route>Route</route> .

Both the [ <route>Route</route> ](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) and the [<move>Moves</move>](/reference/Move/MoveOverview) that the Climber must execute are [fixed](/reference/Glossary#fixed).



::: tip 
Climbers are expected to be able to complete the  <route>Route</route> 
:::

### [Onsight](/reference/Glossary#onsight) Only

In a BetaRoute competition, each Climber gets **only one** [Attempt](/reference/Glossary#attempt) per Route.

Attempt starts when climber makes contact with <route>Route</route> with **any part** of their body.

### ‚è≥ Timelimit

Each Climber has 50 seconds to view the <route>Route</route> from the ground without contacting it.

After a climber's <neuro>viewing</neuro> time is over, the climber has 10 seconds to start the  <route>Route</route> .

Once on the <route>Route</route> the Climber has a maximum of 2 minutes to complete the  <route>Route</route> .

Resting on the <route>Route</route> can reduce a Climber's Execution Score.

## Who?

- A group of climbers who can climb a minimum <route>Route</route> grade.
    - Since BetaRoute competitions expect all climbers to complete the <route>routes</route> in the competition, even climbers that can only climb relatively easy <route>Route grades</route>  can compete against each other. 

## Where?



## Implementation

- Climbers can practice on the <route>Route</route> before the competition.
- Get required Judges.
- Advertise Competition on Social Media and Poster

- Set the <route>Route(s)</route>
- Print all Scoring Sheets

- When to Brush Holds during competition?
- Determine how many rounds based on the number of climbers and Routes.

- Post Scores

### How can Climbers train for a BetaRoute Competition?

Climbers need to familarize themselves with the [<beta>BetaElements</beta>](/reference/Beta/WhatBetaSystem#BetaElements) in the [Reference Section](/reference/ReferenceOverview).

Climbers need to understand the basics of [<beta>BetaScore</beta>](/reference/Score/Overview).

### How do Setters set the Competition?


### What is the Judging process for a BetaRoute Competition?

How many Judges?

## Why?

To see who can climb with the greatest ease

Effortlessly

### Test Climbing Technique Instead Of Musclar Strength

To make climbers who's <beta>technique</beta> far surpasses their <move>brute strength</move>

- A Climber who can crush a V9 could lose to a climber who can only Climb V3, if the V3 climber <beta>finds the optimal Beta</beta>, while the V9 Climber just relies on their <move>muscular strength</move>.

- It's very easy to climb an easy <route>Route</route> with [inoptimal](/reference/Scoring/Overview#) <beta>form</beta>.


### What is BetaRoute testing?

- Ability to plan how to Read the route. Since Climbers only have 50 seconds to look at the <route>Route</route> before starting, they must efficiently plan how they read the route.
    - Where the [<route>Route Starts</route>]() and [<route>Route Finishes </route>]()
    - What Moves they need to perform

- Ability to [<beta>Onsight</beta>](/reference/Glossary#onsight)
    - React to Errors
    - Decide which <beta>Beta Alternatives</beta> to choose.



### Benefits for Climbers

Increases Climber's Ability to [<beta>RouteRead</beta>](/reference/Beta/BetaAction/ReadBeta#route-reading) since BetaComp [integrates](/guide/Why/Value#integrates) [setting](/officials/Setter/Overview) into Climbing so that Climbers can gain a [<neuro>better understanding</neuro>](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview) of what the setting team's [<beta>intended beta</beta>](/reference/CompType/ForcedBeta) is. 

Increases Climber's ability to find the easiest <route>Route</route> in an <envi>Environment</envi>.

Climbers can compete against other climbers at their same level. 

Novice Climbers can beat ExperiencedClimbers.

TallPerson Beta and Short Person Beta becomes irrelevant, so kids can compete against adults.

### Benefits for Setters

Setters can mislead Climbers.

Since Climbers only have one attempt, setters can experiment in creating <route>false routes</route>, just like on <envi>Rock</envi>. Often when Climbers are climbing on <envi>Rock</envi> they have many potential <envi>EnvironmentSurfaces</envi> which could be used as <route>RouteSurfaces</route> but are not necessary and can actually take climbers [<route>OffRoute</route>](/reference/Glossary#offroute) 

### Benefits for Coaches



### Benefit for Gyms 

Gyms benefit from BetaRoute competitions by increasing the accessiblity


Climbers are divided into <route>RouteGrades</route>
