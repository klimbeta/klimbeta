# <envi>Setting a BetaComp</envi>

::: tip
Routesetter is a misnomer given BetaComp's definition of a <route>Route</route> and the [differentiation between a <route>Route</route> and Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview.html#what-is-the-difference-between-Environment-and-Route). 

A person who sets up a BetaWall doesn't set any Routes.

Technically they should be called "Environment Setters", but that's a long name and sometimes they really are only setting a <route>Route</route> and not the Environment, so in a BetaComp they are just called **"Setters"**.
