## Surface Temperature

Sometimes RockWall are too hot to touch. Or are warm enough that they quickly cause sweating in climber's fingertips which drastically increases the [MoveIntensity](/reference/Scoring/Difficulty/MoveDifficulty/MoveIntensity) of a Route.

During a competition the [Holds] can warm up from the conduction of heat from successive competitors gripping the hold, escpecially on a route with a big dyno launch where competitors may grip a hold for tens of seconds.
