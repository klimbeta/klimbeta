## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a climber climbs it. A skill of climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

- The Environment is a novel concept in climbing. Usually when a climber talks about a route they are referring to the Wall, which is an element of the Environment.
- A Route is not a Route unless it leads you to your target location. 
- If a section of a Wall can not be climbed then there is no Route only Wall.
- Ascending and descending the same section of a wall are two different routes even though they both use the exact same wall. 
- A Route is the part of the Environment which makes contact with a Climber. 
- If a climber ascends a Wall using a particular color of holds and another climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first climber, but skips half of them, then did both climbers climb the same route?

The difference between Route and Environment is most important during a BetaWall competition, where there is fixed route that climbers must follow, instead each climber chooses their route and moves on the wall.
