## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Climber climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Climbing. Usually when a Climber talks about a Route they are referring to the [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview), which is an element of the Environment.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a Climber ascends a [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview) using a particular color of holds and another Climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first Climber, but skips half of them, then did both Climbers climb the same Route?


> If a Climber [FootSmears](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a colored indoor hold, are they [OffRoute](/reference/Glossary/Glossary#offroute) because they're not touching a colored hold?
