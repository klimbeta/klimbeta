# How BetaComp Provides Value to the Climbing Community

![ValuePyramid](/ValuePyramid.png)


BetaComp **provides** Value to participants.

How participants **derive** Value from BetaComp.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Accessibility

- Provides access to information about how to plant which currently only exists in the brains of Experienced Climbers.

If you're climbing within your range then grade is irrelevant

The ranges of v12 climber overlap with a v4 climber. The v4 climber can get a better BetaScore.

### Level of Fitness

- A normal fitness person can climb with more elegance than the most physically fit Climber. 

- Paxi Usobiaga Quote about not having technique so he just relies on strength

### Movement Literacy

Literacy provides access to knowledge.

Udini

- Beta is a Language expressed with the Body, Graphically, and Verbally

- The reference section of BetaComp is a library of Movements. 


### Climber Bias

Advantages depending on Climber Height

"morpho Move"
Short Person Beta
Tall Person Beta

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Affiliation Belonging

 


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Avoid Hassles


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## BadgeValue

- If Climbers want to know their max <route>Route</route> Grade, then they'd probably want to know how [Difficult](/reference/Score/DifficultyScore/Overview) they can climb.

- Being the first person to person a BetaElement is like gaining the "Badge" of a First Ascent.
- Get a perfect score on BetaComp's [tests](/tests/TestsOverview) to add to your CV when applying for Climbing jobs.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Connects

- BetaComp connects Climbing to other sports which score execution and difficulty. Climbing; Freestyle skiing and snowboarding; and skateboard already share similar cultures. 

- Climbers can connect over shared Beta. 

- BetaComp gives the Climbing community another event where they can socialize and connect with other Climbers.

- BetaComp will be translated into many languages.

## Design and Aesthetics

- BetaComp encourages innovation in the design of "System boards" like Kilterboard, Tension board, Moonboard, by 


- Watching an elegant Climber flowing around a SprayWall or up a <route>Route</route> is aethetically beautiful.



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Fun and Entertainment

- Creative Competitions are less serious and more fun.

- Who doesn't find dancing fun? BetaComp combines dancing with Climbing.

- BetaGame


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Informs

For your **information**

FYI: There is a thing called Beta

Hey this exists what do you think you could use it for

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Integrates

- Integrates Routesetting knowledge into mainstream Climbing by repurposing routesetting's RICscale into BetaComp's [DifficultyScore](/reference/Score/DifficultyScore/Overview).

- Integrates the techniques used while training on a SprayWall into the current way that Climbers compete. BetaBattle and BetaComp both use SprayWall like a dancefloor. If Janja Garnbret uses SprayWalls to train then they're probably very useful.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Makes Money

- BetaWall reduces the cost of Setting a competition since the BetaWall does not need to be reset between competitions and organizers don't need to spend money on really nice holds of every color since the color of holds is not important for BetaWall competitions. 
- Spectators
- People watch the Olympic Events that BetaComp [mimics](/guide/How/OtherSport).
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Motivation

- BetaComps are designed to be playful

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Nostalgia

- Before monochrome routes became the norm in gyms, setters created routes from multiple colors of holds, just like [BetaWall](/reference/BetaComp/BetaWall)



- Moonkick
- Gaston or Dulfer

Experience a specific Beta like jumping to a [PocketHold]() in Action Directe.

## Organizes



### Easy to search

Easier to search through than any book about climbing technique, since BetaComp has a [search function](/guide/What/WhatBetaCompWebsite#search).

### Formalizes

- Standardized Naming System like [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry) or [biological names of organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)).

- [What is Beta](/guide/What/WhatBeta)

### Systematizes
- Movement Hierarchy
    - Movements have been categorized in the Reference Section, which allows climbers to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between the parts of a Climber's experience.

- BetaComp's BetaSystem allows new concepts and BetaElements to be added to the climbing current knowledge base.

- Beta is broken down into its most simple parts, these simple parts can then be rearranged into sequences or novel elements.



### Measures
- DifficultyScore

- ExecutionScore

- CompositionScore



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Provides Hope

- BetaComp's BetaSystem give hope to Novice Climbers by providing a way to systematically increase their understanding of their climbing experience, instead of just relying on trial and error. Trial and Error can quickly cause a climber to feel hopeless about their project, since they can't communicate what is causing them to fall. The BetaSystem gives Climbers hope by helping them to understand what to expect. 

- Climbing isn't magic, you can learn it.  



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Quality

BetaComp requires Climbers to have high quality Beta, which can easily be applied to any climbing outside of competitions. 
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Anxiety

Being able to externalize the Beta of your project by putting on paper reduces Anxiety by removing your brain's tendency to create [Rehearsal Loops](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100540469) of information that you don't want to forget.  


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Effort

![CognitiveEase_00](/Neuro/CognitiveEase_00.png)

Increasing Cognitive Ease results in feelings of Effortlessness. BetaComp enhances these four factors which determine Cognitive Ease.
- Priming
- Repetition
    - [Tests](/tests/TestsOverview)
- Clarity
    - BetaSystem
- Good Mood
    - Reduces Fatigue
    - Reduces the distance travelled by Climbers by using efficient Routes.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Risk

- The ExecutionScore forces Climbers to have optimal technique, including proper Scapular Control which decreases the conditions for shoulder injuries to occur.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Cost

BetaComp's [reference section](/reference/ReferenceOverview) reduces the time it takes to learn all of routesetting's vocabulary about Routes and Walls, therefore the cost to train routesetters is reduced.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Personally Rewarding

- Be able to track your progress as a Climber by the number of elements that you've understood then mastered.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Saves Time

BetaComp's [reference section](/reference/ReferenceOverview) reduces the time it takes to learn all of Climbing's vocabulary about Moves and routesetting's vocabulary about Routes and Walls.



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Self-Actualization

> Self-actualization can generally be thought of as the full realization of oneâ€™s creative, intellectual, and social potential through internal drive (versus for external rewards like money, status, or power).
- Read more about Self Actualization [here](https://www.verywellmind.com/characteristics-of-self-actualized-people-2795963)

![SelfActualization_00](/SelfActualization_00.png)

> While self-actualized people have concrete goals, they don't see things as simply a means to an end. The journey toward achieving a goal is just as important and enjoyable as actually accomplishing the goal.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Self-Transcendence

Climbers can discover new movements which will shared with the whole Climbing community.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Sensory Appeal

"That<move>Move</move>**looked** really cool"

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Simplifies

BetaComp simplifies Climbing by breaking a Climber's experience into their most simple elements.





<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Variety

- Creativity Competitions increase the **variety** of movements by finding producing novel Moves, Routes, walls, and ways of thinking.

- Variety is incorporated into  the [CompositionScore](/reference/Score/CompositionScore/Overview#variety) of BetaComps.
