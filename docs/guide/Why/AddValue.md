# How BetaComp Adds Value to the Climbing Community

![ValuePyramid](/ValuePyramid.png)


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Affiliation Belonging

 


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Avoid Hassles


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## BadgeValue

- If Climbers want to know their max Route Grade, then they'd probably want to know how [Difficult](/reference/Scoring/Difficulty/Overview) they can climb.

- Being the first person to person a BetaElement is like gaining the "Badge" of a First Ascent.
- Get a perfect score on BetaComp's [tests](/tests/TestsOverview) to add to your CV when applying for Climbing jobs.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Connects

- BetaComp connects Climbing to other sports which score execution and difficulty. Climbing; Freestyle skiing and snowboarding; and skateboard already share similar cultures. 

- Climbers can connect over shared Beta. 

- BetaComp gives the Climbing community another event where they can socialize and connect with other Climbers.

- BetaComp will be translated into many languages.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Design and Aesthetics

- BetaComp encourages innovation in the design of "System boards" like Kilterboard, Tension board, Moonboard, by 


- Watching an elegant Climber flowing around a SprayWall or up a Route is aethetically beautiful.



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Fun and Entertainment

- Creative Competitions are less serious and more fun.

- Who doesn't find dancing fun? BetaComp combines dancing with Climbing.

- BetaGame


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Informs

For your **information**

FYI: There is a thing called Beta

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Integrates

- Integrates Routesetting knowledge into mainstream Climbing by repurposing routesetting's RICscale into BetaComp's [DifficultyScore](/reference/scoring/Difficulty/Overview).

- Integrates the techniques used while training on a SprayWall into the current way that Climbers compete. BetaBattle and BetaComp both use SprayWall like a dancefloor. If Janja Garnbret uses SprayWalls to train then they're probably very useful.

- People watch the Olympic Events that BetaComp [mimics](/guide/How/OtherSport).
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Motivation



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Nostalgia

## Organizes

### Easy to search


### Formalizes

- Standardized Naming System

- [What is Beta](/guide/What/WhatBeta)

### Systematizes
- Movement Hierarchy


### Measures
-DifficultyScore

-ExecutionScore


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Provides Access

- Provides access to information about how to plant which currently only exists in the brains of Experienced Climbers.

### Level of Fitness

- A normal fitness person can climb with more elegance than the most physically fit Climber. 

- Paxi Usobiaga Quote about not having technique so he just relies on strength

### Movement Literacy

Literacy provides access to knowledge.

Udini

- Beta is a Language expressed with the Body, Graphically, and Verbally

- The reference section of BetaComp is a library of Movements. 


### Climber Bias

Advantages depending on Climber Height

"morpho Move"
Short Person Beta
Tall Person Beta

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Provides Hope

Same Project
Shared Project
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Quality

A Climbers ability is easier to **qualify** than to quantify. 
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Anxiety

Being able to externalize the Beta of your project by putting on paper reduces Anxiety by removing your brain's tendency to create [Rehearsal Loops](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100540469) of information that you don't want to forget.  


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Effort

- Reduces the distance travelled by planters by using efficient Routing.
- Increased CognitiveEase leads to feelings of effortlessness.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Risk

- The ExecutionScore forces Climbers to have optimal technique, including proper Scapular Control which decreases the conditions for shoulder injuries to occur.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Reduces Cost

BetaComp's [reference section](/reference/ReferenceOverview) reduces the time it takes to learn all of routesetting's vocabulary about Routes and Walls, therefore the cost to train routesetters is reduced.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Rewards Me

- Be able to track your progress as a Climber by the number of elements that you've understood then mastered.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Saves Time

BetaComp's [reference section](/reference/ReferenceOverview) reduces the time it takes to learn all of Climbing's vocabulary about Moves and routesetting's vocabulary about Routes and Walls.



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Self-Actualization



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Self-Transcendence

Climbers can discover new movements which will shared with the whole Climbing community.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Sensory Appeal

"That Move **looked** really cool"

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Simplifies

BetaComp simplifies Climbing by breaking a Climber's experience into their most simple elements.



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Therapeutic Value




<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Variety

Creativity Competitions increase the **variety** of movements by finding producing novel Moves, Routes, walls, and ways of thinking.
