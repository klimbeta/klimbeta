## Story of Young People Who Want to Combat Climate Change 

### Define Climate Change

<!-- Use Second Person Perspective in the Stories -->

### You want to help, but don't know how.

Planting is a solution.

You can contribute to the 2 Billion Tree by using Plantbeta.

## How exactly BetaComp combats Climate Change

### 1. How Planting combats Climate Change

#### Statistics
- Number of Planters in Canada
- Number of Rookies in Canada
- Area of Land
- Time it takes to train a Rookie
- Number of Trees planted by a Rookie compared to an Experienced Planter.

### 2. How [Plantbeta]() helps Planting to Combat Climate Change

Plantbeta can allow the planting rate to stay the same as past years while increasing the difficulty of the environment that planters must plant. 

Currently there is no way to teach planting



#### How Will the Environment Become More Difficult for Planters

Less Clearcutting: Selective Logging
- Less clearcutting the environments will be more difficult to plant, due to the more obstacles for planters to climb over.

- Leave more slash on the ground to prevent soil erosion.


#### Increase Planter Efficiency
- Increased efficiency, means less planters to plant the same amount of trees, therefore less emissions for transporting, feeding, and housing planters.

#### More Species
More species mix

#### Increase Seedling Survival Rate

- Make the correct way to plant easier to achieve, therefore making planters more likely to plant good quality trees.

- Educating planters on how to plant trees means that the expectations for tree quality can increase. 

- Planters often mess up their density simply because they don't know how to plant optimal density, becuase they are never taught in the first place.

### 3. How [BetaComp](/guide/What/WhatBetaComp) contributes to [Plantbeta](https://klimbeta.github.io/plantbeta/)

#### [Beta System](reference/Beta/WhatBetaSystem)
The [Beta System](reference/Beta/WhatBetaSystem) which is developed in BetaComp can be directly applied to Plantbeta.

#### [BetaScore](/reference/Score/Overview)

The BetaScore encourages efficiency.


[DifficultyScore](/reference/Score/Difficulty/Overview)
- Understand what makes Beta difficult so that planter can choose the easiest Beta.

[ExecutionScore](/reference/Score)
- Understand the optimal way to perform a move, to prevent injury.

#### Move

Planters become physically fit and ambidextrous

#### Route

#### Neuro

#### Environment

### 4. How BetaComp helps to Combat Climate Change

It's not BetaComp that is combatting Climate Change, it's the climbers that are engaged with BetaComp who are directly or indirectly combatting Climate Change.
