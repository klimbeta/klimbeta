## The BetaComp website is created using Vitepress

BetaComp uses Vitepress and Vue.js to create this website. Both are open source projects, which means that they are free to use and are not controlled by a single business. 


### Vitepress

Vitepress has a similar role to the popular publishing tool called Wordpress.

Vitepress was chosen for BetaComp for the following reasons:

- Vitepress is an open source project.
- Like the name suggests, Vitepress is very fast at loading the website.
- Vitepress works (and looks good) on any screensize.
- Vitepress is highly customizable.


### Vue.js

![VueJS](/VueJS.jpeg)

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.

Vue was chosen for BetaComp for a few reasons. 

- Vitepress itself is created with Vue.
- Vue is an open source project which is in the same league as Google's [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Facebook's [React](https://react.dev/).
- There is a large community of VueJs users, so there is lots of support when problems inevitably arise.
