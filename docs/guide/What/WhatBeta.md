# What does 'Beta' mean in Climbing?

Any Climber who has spent some time Climbing has heard the term 'Beta'. Beta is essentially any information that a Climber uses to ascend a Route. 

- Information about what Moves to perform.
- Information about where to go.
- Information about what to pay attention to. 
- Information about what tools are required. 

::: tip

## What does 'Beta' mean in a BetaComp? 

BetaComp defines Beta as a system composed of four subsystems: [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview), [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview), [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview), and [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview). Each subsystem or aspect of Beta affects the other aspects of Beta. Everything is connected.

## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) is an Abstraction of the [Environment](/reference/Environment/EnvironmentOverview). The Route **only** exists in the minds of Climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a Climber climbs it. A skill of Climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

The [Environment](/reference/Envrionment/EnvironmentOverview) is a novel concept in Climbing. Usually when a Climber talks about a Route they are referring to the [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview), which is an element of the Environment.

::: danger Ask Yourself...
> If a Climber ascends a [Wall](/reference/Environment/Wall/Overview) using a particular color of holds and another Climber comes along ascends the same Wall using the same color of holds as the first Climber, but skips half of them, then did both Climbers climb the same Route?


> If a Climber [FootSmears](/reference/Move/FootMove/FootSmear) beside a colored indoor hold, are they [OffRoute](/reference/Glossary/Glossary#offroute) because they're not touching a colored hold?

## A Climber's Goal Affects What Aspects of Beta they Attend to.

<!-- ![InsertImage] of BetaComp in ecosystem map relating it to the other types of Climbing -->

There are many goals in Climbing, your goal determines the part of Beta that Climbers pay attention to.

It is important to remember that every type of Climbing uses every aspect of Beta, each of the four types of Climbing just emphasize different the different aspects of Beta.

### When Completing a Particular Route is a Climber's Goal

<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Route Climbing Bouldering Lead Speed Combined Olympics -->
<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Route Climbing Dyno Psico Buildering -->

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) aspect of Beta

Free Climbing a Route without using any tools to advance yourself along the Route. Any Moves, even if they aren't pretty, are used to complete the Route. This is by far the most common goal of Climbing. Some Routes finish at an arbitrary location, or they could finish in the middle of a Big Wall. 

- Bouldering
- Lead Climbing
- Speed Climbing
- Dyno Competition
- Psicobloc Competition
- Buildering
- System Walls
    - Moonboard
    - Kilterboard
    - Tension board

### When Moving in a Particular Way is a Climber's Goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage] of Move Climbing -->

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Move](/reference/Move/MoveOverview) aspect of Beta. 

- Climbers focus on Moves when they are training to complete a Route.
- Climbing with a weight vest.
- High altitude Alpinism without supplemental oxygen.
    - Climbers just try to keep moving when the movement of breathing becomes a challenge and each step feels strenuous, while the same Move at sea level would be easy. 
    - Climbers usually have completed their Route before with the aid of supplemental oxygen.
- Campusboarding
- Deadhang Competition
- Grip Strength Competition
    - Squamish Boulder
:::

### When Thinking a Particular Way is a Climber's Goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Free Solo, Free Base, Alain Robert over knives -->

::: tip Climbers focus on [Neuro](/reference/Neuro/NeuroOverview) aspect of Beta. 

- Free Solo Climbing and Free Base Climbing
    - Climbers cultivate the ability to calm their minds so that they can climb without any protection in Environments where a fall will result in death or life changing injury.
    - Climbers usually Free Solo Routes that they have already completed and are well under their maximum difficulty. 
    - Completing the Route is necessary but not the ultimate goal of Free Soloing. 
    - Climbers seek the release of the neurotransitter **Adrenaline**, which occurs when Climbers are in a stressful situation. Climbers often describe the feeling of "heightened senses"

- Flow Climbing
    - A subset of Neuro Climbing is Flow Climbing.
    - Requires a SprayWall with a high density of Holds.
    - Meditative
    - Since Flow Climbing often involves Down Climbing, it is difficult to belay so an Autobelay must be used or Flow Climbing is performed low to the ground like Bouldering.
    - Flow Climbing usually has lots of Traversing, Down Climbing and Climbing in circles. 
    - Climbers grip what ever hold they happen to be in a position to use. 
    - Flow Climbing is only possible when the gym is not crowded.
