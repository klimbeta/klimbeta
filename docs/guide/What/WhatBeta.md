# What does 'Beta' mean in Climbing?

Any climber who has spent some time climbing has heard the term 'Beta'. Beta is essentially any information that a climber uses to ascend a route. 

- Information about what moves to perform.
- Information about where to go.
- Information about what to pay attention to.

## What does 'Beta' mean in a BetaComp? 

In a BetaComp Beta is defined as a system composed of four subsystems: Environment, Move, Route, and Neuro.

## What is the difference between Environment and Route?

Philosophically, a Route is an Abstraction of the Environment. The Route **only** exists in the minds of climbers. There are no start holds in nature. The Environment is Concrete and exists whether or not a climber climbs it. A skill of climbers who seek first ascents is to see potential Routes in the Environment.

- The Environment is a novel concept in climbing. Usually when a climber talks about a route they are referring to the Wall.
- A Route is not a route unless it leads you to your target location. 
- If a section of a wall can not be climbed then there is no route only wall.
- Ascending and descending the same section of a wall are two different routes even though they both use the exact same wall. 
- A Route is the part of the Environment which makes contact with a Climber. 
- If a climber climbs ascends a wall using a particular color of holds and another climber comes along ascends the wall using the same color of holds but skips half of them, then did both climbers climb the same route?

The difference between Route and Environment is most important during a BetaWall competition, where there is fixed route that climbers must follow, instead each climber chooses their route and moves on the wall.


## What is your focus when Climbing?

<!-- ![InsertImage] of BetaComp in ecosystem map relating it to the other types of Climbing -->

There are many goals in climbing, your goal determines the part of Beta you choose to focus on.

It is important to remember that every type of climbing uses Beta, each of the four types of climbing just emphasize different aspects of Beta.

## Being in a particular Environment is the climber's goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage]() which contains with all Forms of WallClimbing -->

::: tip Climbing focused on reaching a location in an [Environment]() by any means necessary.  

- Alpinism
    - Climbers want stand on a particular landmark, often the summit of a mountain.
- Tree Climbing
    - There are no routes in trees.
- Aid Climbing
    - Climbers use tools to advance themselves along the route.
- Ice Climbing
- Mixed Climbing
    - See The Alpinist Film

## Completing a particular Route is the climber's goal

<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Route Climbing Bouldering Lead Speed Combined Olympics -->
<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Route climbing Dyno Psico Buildering -->

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) aspect of Beta

Free climbing a route without using any tools to advance yourself along the route. Any moves, even if they aren't pretty, are used to complete the Route. This is by far the most common goal of climbing. Some routes finish at an arbitrary location, or they could finish in the middle of a Big Wall. 

- Bouldering
- Lead Climbing
- Speed Climbing
- Dyno Competition
- Psicobloc Competition
- Buildering
- System Walls
    - Moonboard
    - Kilterboard
    - Tension board

## Moving in a particular way is the climber's goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage] of Move Climbing -->

::: tip Climbers focus on the [Move]() aspect of Beta. 

- Climbers focus on Moves when they are training to complete a route.
- Climbing with a weight vest.
- High altitude Alpinism without supplemental oxygen.
    - Climbers just try to keep moving when the movement of breathing becomes a challenge and each step feels strenuous, while the same move at sea level would be easy. 
    - Climbers usually have completed their route before with the aid of supplemental oxygen.
- Campusboarding
- Deadhang Competition
- Grip Strength Competition
    - Squamish Boulder

## Thinking a particular way is the climber's goal.

<!-- ![InsertImage]() of Free Solo, Free Base, Alain Robert over knives -->

::: tip Climbers focus on [Neuro]() aspect of Beta. 

- Free Solo Climbing and Free Base Climbing
    - Climbers cultivate the ability to calm their minds so that they can climb without any protection in Environments where a fall will result in death or life changing injury.
    - Climbers usually Free Solo routes that they have already completed and are well under their maximum difficulty. 
    - Completing the route is necessary but not the ultimate goal of Free Soloing. 
    - Climbers seek the release of the neurotransitter **Adrenaline**, which occurs when climbers are in a stressful situation. Climbers often describe the feeling of "heightened senses"

<!-- ## Flow Climbing

![FlowClimbing_02](/FlowClimbing_02.png)

::: tip A subset of Neuro Climbing is Flow Climbing.

- Requires a SprayWall with a high density of Holds.
- Meditative
- Since Flow Climbing often involves Down Climbing, it is difficult to belay so an Autobelay must be used or Flow Climbing is performed low to the ground like Bouldering.
- Flow Climbing usually has lots of Traversing, Down Climbing and Climbing in circles. 
- Climbers grip what ever hold they happen to be in a position to use. 
- Flow Climbing is only possible when the gym is not crowded.
