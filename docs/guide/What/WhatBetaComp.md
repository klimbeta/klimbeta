# What is a BetaComp?

A BetaComp is a **group** of Climbing competitions which test a Climber's [Beta](/guide/What/WhatBeta), not just a Climber's ability to complete a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) or how fast they can complete a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview).

BetaComp mimics the competition structures of other Olympic Sports. Following the names of other  sports, in the Olympics BetaComp would be called "*Freestyle* Climbing" (like *Freestyle* Skiing) or "*Artistic* Climbing" (like *Artistic* Gymnastics).


::: tip Even if a BetaComp never makes it into the Olympics, it will still [provide value](/guide/Why/AddValue) to the Climbing community and beyond.

You don't need to have a formal competition hosted by a gym to compete in a BetaComp!

::: tip The defining feature of BetaComps is that Climbers are scored using a [DifficultyScore](/reference/Scoring/Difficulty/Overview), an [ExecutionScore](/reference/Scoring/Execution/Overview) and a [CompositionScore](/reference/Scoring/Composition/Overview).
