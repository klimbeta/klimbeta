# What is a BetaComp?

A BetaComp is a type of Climbing competition which tests a Climber's [Beta](/guide/What/WhatBeta), not just a Climber's ability to complete a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview) or how fast they can complete a [Route](/reference/Route/RouteOverview).

BetaComp mimics the competition structures of other Olympic Sports. Following the names of other  sports, in the Olympics BetaComp would be called "*Freestyle* Climbing" (like *Freestyle* Skiing) or "*Artistic* Climbing" (like *Artistic* Gymnastics).


::: tip Even if a BetaComp never makes it into the Olympics, it will still [add value](/guide/Why/AddValue) to the Climbing community and beyond.
