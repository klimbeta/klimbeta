# What is a BetaComp?

A BetaComp is a type of climbing competition which tests a climber's [Beta](/guide/What/WhatBeta), not just a climber's ability to complete a Route or how fast they can complete a Route.

BetaComp mimics the competition structures of other Olympic Sports. Following the names of other  sports, in the Olympics BetaComp would be called "*Freestyle* Climbing" (like *Freestyle* Skiing) or "*Artistic* Climbing" (like *Artistic* Gymnastics).

The defining feature of BetaComps is that Climbers are scored using a [DifficultyScore](/reference/scoring/Difficulty/Overview) and an [ExecutionScore](/reference/scoring/Execution/Overview).


::: tip Even if a BetaComp never makes it into the Olympics, it will still add value to the climbing community.
