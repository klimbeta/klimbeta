# BetaComp in Other Sports

::: tip What makes a BetaComp?
Wall is constant, Route and Moves are decided by Competitor.
:::


The competitors are scored on the difficulty and excecution of their performance.

There is no opposition to the competitors of these sports. Each athelete or team performs their routines alone without any opposition, unlike combat sports or ball sports.

**A perfectly executed easy performance can lose to a very strenous performance with some errors.**
